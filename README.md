JavaScript and Python knowledge will be necessary.
- **Chatrooms:** Future work would include creating a digital chatroom to provide a platform for members to engage in discussions.

## Testing & Bugs

### Bug: Custom Google font not showing

Using a custom Google Font did not show initially when targeting `html` element. This is because bootstrap defines it's own, ["native" font stack](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/reboot/#native-font-stack) which meant I had to override elements with a higher specificity in the CSS file. e.g. `navbar-brand`

### Bug: X-Overflow on footer

TODO: Fix x-overflow caused by footer

### Bug: Page refreshing when submitting form

When clicking the "Join!" button it was only refreshing to the form page again. I wanted it to go to a thank you page.

Using [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) I found that form has an `action` attribute that can set the URL to process a form submission.
