## Project Development & Planning

I followed the principles of User Experience (UX) in the planning and development of my website, including the 5 planes of which are Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface.

I wanted to ensure that the webaite was easy to use, responsive, accessible and intuitive. It was imperative that the website met the goals and needs of both the user and client.

### Project Goals

#### **Project Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to create a website for the *Bridgend Book Club*. The website will serve as a platform for members to find clubs tailored to their reading interest, as well as to discover upcoming events and meetings. The website will also provide information about the club, including its history, membership details and contact information.

The website will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all members of the club. It will be easy to navigate, with clear sections for different types of content.

Since all meetings and discussions are held in person, the website will not include any virtual meeting features. Instead, it will focus on providing information about upcoming events and meetings.

The website will be built using modern web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It will be hosted on a reliable web server, ensuring that it is always available to members.

Overall, the goal of this project is to create a website that enhances the experience of being a member of the Bridgend Book Club. It is the ambition to foster a sense of community among members and encourage more people to join the club by providing an online platform.

#### **Client Background**

- The client is a passionate and well-established book club committee comprising avid readers of diverse literary genres.

- They have been meeting in person for years, fostering a strong sense of community and a shared love for reading.

- Due to changing circumstances, including the desire to expand their reach and accommodate virtual meetings, they've decided to create a digital presence through a website.

- The committee aims to use the website as a hub for book recommendations, event announcements.

- They want the website to reflect the club's values of inclusivity, intellectual growth, and a welcoming atmosphere for book enthusiasts of all backgrounds.

#### **Client Goals**

- Create a digital presence for the book club.
- Showcase diverse literary interests.
- Enable book recommendations.
- Announce club events through the website.
- Promote member engagement.
- Reflect inclusivity and a welcoming atmosphere in the website's design and content.

#### **User Goals**

- Discover new books and engage in discussions.
- Stay informed about club events and schedules.
- Connect with like-minded readers.
- Participate in both online and offline activities.
- Navigate the website intuitively.
- Feel welcome and included in the book club community.

### Research

#### **Market Review**

A market review of book club websites reveals a dynamic landscape shaped by the evolving preferences of avid readers. These websites have evolved into thriving digital communities where members seek not only book recommendations but also engaging discussions and events. The market highlights a growing demand for platforms that cater to diverse literary interests, with users seeking inclusivity and opportunities to connect with like-minded readers. The success of these websites hinges on their ability to provide intuitive navigation, personalized reading experiences, and a welcoming atmosphere. As book clubs continue to embrace the digital realm, the market review underscores the importance of user-centric design and robust features that foster meaningful interactions and support the shared passion for literature.

### Design, Layout & Structure

I chose to design a minimalist book club website, where the digital realm seamlessly marries the timeless charm of a paper book. At the heart of my design philosophy lies the desire to create an online space that evokes the sensory delight and simplicity of holding a well-loved book in your hands. Here's an overview of my design, layout, and structural principles:

#### **Wireframes**
<!-- Insert links here for HOME/ ABOUT/ BOOK CLUB/ JOIN US wireframes-->

#### **Structure**

The scope, user, and client goals, as well as the concepts of IXD (interaction design), were all taken into consideration when building the site's structure to ensure that I was meeting user expectations and making everything as intuitive as I could.

The site has a simple structure made up of 4 main pages:

- Homepage - a short introduction to the bookclub and it's ethos and a summary of the book clubs included and photos of the current books being discussed at each book club.
- About Us - more detailed information about the book club, it's committee members and a contact email.
- Book Clubs - information about the 5 book club genres that have been established, alongisde a brief summary of which book is being currently being discussed in each book club.
- Join Us - information about joining the book club and a form to express interest in joining which specific clubs.
- There are also 7 additional sub pages:
  - 5 individual book club pages: including information about the book, author and next book club event.
  - A thank you page for when a user had submitted a form.
  - a 404 page for when a user lands on a non-existint page.

<!--On desktop and tablet, the site's navigation bar is fixed at the top of the screen; on mobile, it scrolls with the rest of the page because it takes up too much screen real estate and detracts from the user experience. This feature makes it easy for users to access any page they need at any time and is best suited for repeat visitors who are familiar with the site's layout. Each page also has a footer with connections to the book club's social media pages.-->

Additional navigation options include a preferred path through the website via suggested links that would lead a new visitor through the information. This is designed for people who wish to find out more about the individual book clubs. Suggested route: HOME> VIEW (Book Clubs)

[Home Page - Individual Book Club View Button](assets/images/readme/structure-screenshot-view.webp)

#### **Colour**

 I chose a palette that soothes the eyes and enhances content readability by utilising a soft and muted colour palette.

![colour pallete](assets/images/readme/colour-scheme-.webp)

- *#fbf9f6* The subtle, parchment-like background texture subtly mirrors the tactile sensation of a physical book. It's a gentle reminder of the comforting weight of literature.

- *#000000* I chose the color black for the book club text to evoke a sense of elegance and timelessness, reminiscent of the classic ink on the pages of a well-loved book.
  
- *#ffffff* Like the margins of a book page, whitespace surrounds the content, offering a serene reading experience. It allows your eyes to rest, emphasizing the beauty of both text and images.

#### **Fonts**

I imported [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and used [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) (with a fallback of Sans Serif) for the main body text. Typography is the soul of a book, and I carefully selected classic, readable fonts that transport you to the comforting pages of a novel.

*Favicon*

</details>

- I added a favicon feature to the Bridgend Book Club logo in the top tab of the site in order to enhnce:
  
  - *Branding and Recognition:* A favicon is a small but significant branding element. It helps users quickly recognize and remember your website when they have multiple tabs open in their browser. It's like a mini logo that reinforces your brand identity.
  - *Professionalism:* Having a favicon demonstrates professionalism and attention to detail. It shows that I've invested time and effort in making your website visually appealing and user-friendly.
  - *User Experience:* When users bookmark the book club's website or add it to their browser's favorites, the favicon appears next to the website's name. This makes it easier for users to find and revisit your site.
  - *Tab Identification:* In a browser, the favicon appears in the tab's title bar. It provides a visual cue that helps users distinguish the book club's website from others when they have multiple tabs open. 
  - *Credibility:* A well-designed favicon can enhance the website's credibility and trustworthiness. It's a small but important aspect of web design that contributes to the overall user experience.
  - *Consistency:* Including a favicon is part of creating a consistent and cohesive design. It adds to the overall aesthetic and complements the design choices I've made elsewhere on the book club's website.

The following user goals were removed from the README due to knowledge limitations. The following future features would be introduced to address the unmet identified user goals.

- **Personalised Reading Lists:** Utilize JavaScript and Python to allow users to create personalize reading lists based on their activity on the site (i.e based on the bookclubs the user has signed up to);
- **Book Suggestions:** To allow users to post a book suggestion.Without creting another form that duplicates the same behaiour as the 'Join US' form included in this project. i.e. A form that doesn't actually POST any data to facilitate collection. JavaScript and Python knowledge will be necessary.
- **Chatrooms:** Future work would include creating a digital chatroom to provide a platform for members to engage in discussions.

## Testing & Bugs

### Bug: Custom Google font not showing

Using a custom Google Font did not show initially when targeting `html` element. This is because bootstrap defines it's own, ["native" font stack](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/reboot/#native-font-stack) which meant I had to override elements with a higher specificity in the CSS file. e.g. `navbar-brand`

### Bug: X-Overflow on footer

Navbar was causing x-overflow because of the gap spacing provided by boostrap by default when using `display: flex` or `display: grid` on elements.
Using the `gap-0` on the navbar element removed the gap which was causing the element to be wider than the width of the viewport.

### Bug: Page refreshing when submitting form

When clicking the "Join!" button it was only refreshing to the form page again. I wanted it to go to a thank you page.

Using [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) I found that form has an `action` attribute that can set the URL to process a form submission.

### Bug: Hero image header h1 opacity

When setting a filter to make the hero image more opaque using `filter: opacity(0.3)` it was altering the appearance of the `h1` also which made it unreadable.
*fix*: Adapting code found on a blog from LogRocket about [image overlays](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-image-overlays-css/#using-linear-gradient-css-function) using the linear gradient method.

### Bug: Card group images not aligning

When changing the images and titles to the respective book genres they became ![misaligned to each other](./assets/images/bugs/cards-not-aligning-consistent.png).

*fix* : Making use of Boostraps `row` and `row col` classes [found used here for grid cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#grid-cards).

### Bug: Footer too large when page contains minimal content

When viewing a page that contained minimal content within the main section the footer would rise far up the page giving the appearance of an ![exceptionally tall footer.](./assets/images/bugs/).

*fix* : Making use of `flexbox` to create a sticky footer. Code was adapted from  [Philip Walton's Sticky Footer demo](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/).

    </details>

Ensuring the accessibility of the Bridgend Book Club website was identified as a priority. Accessibility allows all users, including those with disabilities, to access and use our content effectively. To assess the accessibility of the website I utilised the [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) accessibility evaluation tool as a development tool to help identify and address accessibility issues.

A screenshot has been included to show the Home Page WAVE evalutation which indicates 0 errors, 0 contrast errors, 7 features (including alt text), 13 structural elements (including navigation, header, main content and footer) and 20 ARIA labels.
